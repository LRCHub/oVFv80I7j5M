[00:15.90] We've got solid-state technology
[00:21.98] Tapes on the floor
[00:24.80] Some songs we can't afford to play
[00:34.19] When we came here today
[00:38.67] All I wanted to say
[00:41.44] Is how much I miss you
[00:52.44] 
[00:51.90] Alcohol and cotton balls
[01:00.80] And some drugs
[01:02.43] We can afford after take
[01:09.70] When we came here today
[01:13.67] We all felt something true
[01:17.50] Now I'm red-eyed and blue
