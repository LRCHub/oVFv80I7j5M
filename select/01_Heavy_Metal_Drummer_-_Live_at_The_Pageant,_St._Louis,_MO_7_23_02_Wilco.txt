I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer, she fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer, she fell in love with another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned

Lifted up her shirts at the battle of the bands
He twirled his sticks and she helped him to his van
She fell in love with the drummer, she fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

Unluck my body and move myself to dance
Feel the warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, hey
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, hey

Maybe some of you were in those bands
Maybe I saw you play
You know I never, by the way, I'm not
That song isn't audiobiographical
I never played in a band who played KISS covers
I didn't, Uncle Tuplo played "Rock And Roll All Night" once or twice
But I'm talking about the band that this guy was in
Were you in a heavy metal band?
No, sir?
Somebody here was in a heavy metal band

And I'm just sorry that I, I'm sorry that I missed the fun
That's all I was trying to say in it, I'm not passing judgement
If I could wear spandex, I would
But my ass is too big
